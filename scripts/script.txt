        [WIZARD TOX turns around]
        WIZARD TOX: Their brains are not built for it, you know.
        WIZARD TOX: They'd end up pulling a frog from behind a child's ear.
        WIZARD TOX: Or turning a frog into a person! Can you imagine?

    .. choice:: ...that's a bit sexist!

        GOBLIT: ...that's a bit...
